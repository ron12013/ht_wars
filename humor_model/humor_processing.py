"""David Donahue 2016. This script preprocesses the data for the humor model.
At the very least, the script is designed to prepare all tweets in the hashtag wars dataset.
It will load all tweet pairs for each hashtag. It will look up all glove embeddings for all tweet
pairs in the hashtag. It will generate pronunciation embeddings for all tweet pairs in the hashtag.
It will save a numpy array."""
